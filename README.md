# About

This all started on a plane flight home. Technically, it started after a pairing session recently on some WPF code where I lamented "Oh WPF you crazy bastard, I missed you". Anyway, I was frustrated by some work stuff and started pondering on a simple question:

## How can I demonstrate the disruptions I face when I'm in the office?

I've been getting a lot of visitors to my desk at the moment and would love to easily capture a bunch of data about when I'm productive and when I'm not. There's many [pomodoro](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/) style apps out there but I was looking for something I could tailor to my use case.

So I started bashing out a simple WPF app to do the job and got midway through before I paused.

## What else have I got on the backburner that I could tie into this app?

There's things that I've been meaning to make time for over the past few months that I feel bad for the people I've promised stuff to. In particular:

 - I owe [@xpaulbettsx](https://twitter.com/xpaulbettsx) some feedback on [Shimmer](https://github.com/github/shimmer) - perhaps I can use it as an installer for this app rather than WiX/ClickOnce/etc.
 - I've got an idea for a Windows 8 app (or perhaps something Mono-related?) along these lines - how should I use the Portable Class Library tools, how can i structure this app for maximum portability, how far can I push this etc etc
 - I've been playing around with [event sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) concepts but would like to see how it fits within the context of this app.
 - I don't have the spare time for Code52 that I'd hoped for, but perhaps I could write up some posts on my learnings from building an app at this time.

So of course this needs a rocking name...
